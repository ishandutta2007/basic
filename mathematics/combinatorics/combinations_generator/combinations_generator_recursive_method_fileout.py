# Function to get combinations of objects

# Method self-discovered, so there may be better ones

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call cmbsf() function with a, r and ofln
#   where a is list/tuple/array
#   r is what combinations are required
#   ofln is output file name (will be overwritten)

# Method is to use successive calls of same function
# to populate the list with combinations

# Output is sorted according to indices of a
# Same elements of a are treated as distinct
