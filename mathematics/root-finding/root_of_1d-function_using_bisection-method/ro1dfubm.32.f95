! Subroutine (32-bit) to find a root of a one
! dimensional function using Bisection Method

! ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
! Call subroutine bsctn_32() with:
!   f(x) = external function whose root is to be found
!   a0,b0 = range in which root is to be found (inclusive)
!   er = tolerance below which root will be accepted,
!        i.e., when |f(c)|<er, c is accepted as root
!   c = output, which will contain the root
!   istt = status code of subroutine's execution (see below for details)

! STATUS CODE:
! istt=1, success: root found between a and b
! istt=2, success: root found at a
! istt=3, success: root found at b
! istt=-1, error: root could not be found between a and b

! NOTE:
! Don't forget to define your function as external
! If f(x) does not cross the x-axis but only touches it,
!   like f(x)=x*x at x=0, then that root will most probably not be found
! Below method does not check for opposite signs to continue operating
!   as conventional bisection method does, but it is then likely to find
!   a root if it exists, even if signs at boundaries are same
! Subroutine is optimized for minimum calls to f(x)

    external g
    a0=-2.0; b0=20.0
    er=3.e-7

    call bsctn_32(g,a0,b0,er,c,istt)

    if(istt==1) then
        write(6,*) 'Root found at',c
    else if(istt==2) then
        write(6,*) 'Root found at a,',c
    else if(istt==3) then
        write(6,*) 'Root found at b,',c
    else if(istt==-1) then
        write(6,*) 'Root could not be found in given range.'
    endif
    end

! Function whose root is to be found
    real function g(x)
    g=x*x-1.0
    endfunction
