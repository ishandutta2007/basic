# Function to find a root of a one
# dimensional function using Secant Method

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Specify two initial guesses x0 and x1,
#   they must be near the desired root
# Specify the function y(x), whose root is needed
# Specify positive small er; when |y(x2)|<er, further
#   computation stops and x2 is returned as root

def scnt(x0,x1,er):
    ''' (num,num,num) -> num

        Function to find root of y(x)=0
        using Secant Method
        x0, x1 are initial guesses
        er is a small positive number such that when
        |y(x2)|<er, further calculation is stopped
        and x2 is returned as root
    '''
    while True:
        x2=x1-y(x1)*(x1-x0)/(y(x1)-y(x0))
        if(abs(y(x2))<er):
            return x2
        x0=x1
        x1=x2

import math
def y(x):
    ''' num -> num

        Input Function y(x), whose root is to be found
    '''
    return math.sin(x)

x0=2.1
x1=4.8
er=2.0e-16
x2=scnt(x0,x1,er)
print(x2,y(x2))
