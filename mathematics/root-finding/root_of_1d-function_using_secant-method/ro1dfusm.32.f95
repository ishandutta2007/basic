! Subroutine (32-bit) to find a root of a one
! dimensional function using Secant Method

! ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
! Specify two initial guesses x0 and x1,
!   they must be near the desired root
! Specify the function y(x), whose root is needed
! Specify positive small er; when |y(x2)|<er, further
!   computation stops and x2 is returned as root

    x0=2.1
    x1=4.8
    er=9.0e-8

    call scnt_32(x0,x1,er,x2)

    write(6,*) x2,y(x2)
    end

! Input Function y(x), whose root is to be found
    real function y(x)
    y=sin(x)
    endfunction

! Subroutine (32-bit) to find root of y(x)=0
! using Secant Method
! x0, x1 are initial guesses
! er is a small positive number such that when
! |y(x2)|<er, further calculation is stopped
! and x2 is returned as root
    subroutine scnt_32(x0,x1,er,x2)
    do
      x2=x1-y(x1)*(x1-x0)/(y(x1)-y(x0))
      if(abs(y(x2))<er) exit
      x0=x1
      x1=x2
    enddo
    endsubroutine
