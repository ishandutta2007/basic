# Function to find roots of a one dimensional
# function by recursively using Bisection Method

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call function bsctns() with:
#   f = function whose root is to be found (must return num)
#   a,b = range in which root is to be found (inclusive)
#   er = tolerance in f() below which root will be accepted,
#        i.e., when |f(c)|<er, c is accepted as root
#   nk = in how many equal intervals to divide (a, b) into,
#        recursive root finding is attempted in each of
#        these intervals
#   nd = simply put, keep this low like 1, 2, 3 or 4. this int
#        decides how closely to single-out a root once it is found.
#        a larger int will better single-out the root but will
#        require several function calls too, so better keep it low
# Define f(x), external function whose roots are to be found
# Function bsctns() outputs list of roots

# ALGORITHM:
# (a, b) is divided into nk equal intervals then bisection
# method is applied in all these intervals (say one of them is
# (p, q)). if a root r is found in (p, q), then new roots are recursively
# attempted to find between (p, r-dr1) and (r+dr2, q) where
# dr1 and dr2 are approximately calculated such that all x
# in (r-dr1, r+dr2) have |f(x)| < er. how better dr1 and dr2 are
# depends on how large nd is, but a large nd will also require
# many function calls (which might be costly) so better keep nd low.

# SUGGESTIONS:
# Obviously this method is not guaranteed to find all roots of the
# function, so it is suggested that:
# 1. If possible check the plot of f(x) and identify all intervals
#    where roots might exist, it will be best if f(x) has opposite
#    signs on the ends of these intervals
# 2. If satisfactory roots are not found, first try increasing
#    er (compromise with accuracy); next try to increase nk (compromise
#    with efficiency); lastly, changing nd should not have much effect
#    but try to vary it in 1-5 (large nd is compromise with efficiency,
#    low nd is compromise with accuracy)

# NOTE:
# If f(x) does not cross the x-axis but only touches it,
#   like f(x)=x*x at x=0, then that root will most probably not be found
# Below method does not check for opposite signs to continue operating
#   as conventional bisection method does, which makes it likely to find
#   a root if it exists, even if signs at boundaries are not opposite
# Method is optimized for minimum calls to f(x)
# Roots will not be sorted
