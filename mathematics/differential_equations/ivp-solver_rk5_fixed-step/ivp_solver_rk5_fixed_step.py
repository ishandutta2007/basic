# Function to solve coupled ordinary differential equations with
# initial values (coupled-ODEs-IVP) using Butcher's Runge Kutta 5 method

# The program solves coupled ODEs y'[i]=f(x,y[j])[i]; {i,j: 0-->n-1}

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call function brk5() with:
#   fx = external function that defines ODEs (see below INPUT FUNCTION)
#   h = step size in which x increases per iteration
#   ns = number of iterations
#   x0 = initial value of x, from which iteration begins
#   y0 = initial value(s) of y at x0
#   ofln = output file name

# OUTPUT:
# Output is in the text file as specified under INPUTS.
# Data is arranged as x variable followed by y vector.

# NOTE:
# This implementation of Butcher's Runge-Kutta 5 uses
#   constant step size, predefined by user
# If you want to run RK5 from x0 to x1, then h or ns can be calculated as:
#   h = (x1 - x0) / ns
#   ns = (x1 - x0) / h
# A higher order ODE can be broken into coupled ODEs, e.g.,
#   y''+100*y=0, can be broken as y1'=y2; y2'=-100*y1

# INPUT FUNCTION
# Simply define functions in a list: [f0, f1, ...]
# for coupled ODEs: y'[i]=f(x,y[j])[i]
# Example:
# Suppose you want to solve: y'[0]=y[1]; y'[1]=-100*y[0]
# Then define f = [y[1], -100 * y[0]]
# This means f are simply the RHS in the coupled ODEs when arranged properly.
def gx(x, y):
    f = [y[1], -100 * y[0]]
    return f
