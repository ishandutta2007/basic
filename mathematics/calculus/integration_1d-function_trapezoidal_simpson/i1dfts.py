# Functions to integrate one-dimensional function
# using Trapezoidal and Simpson's 1/3rd Rules

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call required function with parameters
#   a, b = range in which to integrate
#   n = number of sample points to take for integration (including end-points)
# Specify the function to be integrated in f(x)

# NOTE:
# Choosing a large n will cause truncation error to reduce
#   but will increase roundoff error, so choose as per needs
# In case your function has some parameters, you can specify
#   them as global variables, they are then automatically passed to fx
# Note that integration(f(x),(a,b))=-integration(f(x),(b,a))
#   so specify the range a,b accordingly
# In case of Simpson's 1/3rd rule, number of points n should be odd (or
#   equivalently, number of intervals should be even); however, if n is
#   given even, the program uses n-1 points (maintaining the range a to b)

# Below is example of integration(d/(1+x*x),(x,0,1)), with d=4
