# Function to get list of prime factors of a positive integer

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Before calling the main function pdvsrs(), generate
#   a list of primes prms containing primes more than sqrt
#   of number whose prime factors you want to compute
#   Use the provided function prm_ert_upto_n_lst() for this
#   This step needs to be done only once
# Then simply call pdvsrs() function with the number whose
#   prime factors are required

# It is safe to generate up to sqrt(n) but usually less
# will also work. If it gives error that "index out of range" for
# prms, that means you need to generate more prime numbers.
# Sometimes prime numbers even up to sqrt(n) will also
# not work, in which case make sure to generate one extra
# prime number higher than sqrt(n) (this problem should mathematically
# not be there, but exists due to floating number limitations)
