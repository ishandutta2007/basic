# Function to solve Knapsack 0-1 Problem
# using Dynamic Programming

# Knapsack 0-1 Problem is:
# Given m items with values v and weights w
#   which items to choose so that the total value is maximized
#   and the total weight is <= [given] knapsack capacity, wm
# i.e. maximize sum(tt[i] * v[i]) for sum(tt[i] * w[i]) <= wm
#   where tt[i] is 0 or 1, and i runs on items

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call function knapsack_01_dp(v, w, wm) with:
#   v = list/tuple of values (int)
#   w = list/tuple of weights (int)
#   wm = maximum capacity of knapsack (int)

# OUTPUT:
# The function returns a bool list which tells which
#   item to include in the knapsack

# NOTE:
# The algorithm gives "one" solution, there may actually be many
