# Template function to generate arbitrary number of nested for-loops

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO:
# Call ffor() function with ranges of for-loops:
#   r1 = list/tuple of beginning of loops
#   r2 = list/tuple of ending of loops
#   st = list/tuple of step sizes of loops (it is optional and
#        by default it will be a list of 1)
# Mention the required procedures in the places marked in the
#   function, noting that m is (m+1)^th loop, so if there are
#   4 nested loop, the topmost has m=0, innermost has m=3;
#   and k is current loop's iterator

# NOTE:
# For any other parameters within loops, you will have to
#   include those in nonlocal statement
# Ranges follow Python's convention, so all entries in r2 are
#   excluded, i.e., if r1 = (1, ...) and r2 = (5, ...) then
#   the first loop will run on 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
# It uses recursions, which is limited, but can be changed by
#   sys.setrecursionlimit(1500) command; use it at your own risk

# Method self-discovered...
