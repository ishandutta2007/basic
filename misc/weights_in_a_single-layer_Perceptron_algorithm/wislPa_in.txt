How input parameters are arranged above:
n k m b r
w_i
x_ij d_j

What do symbols mean:
n = number of inputs
k = dimension of input
m = number of times to iterate
b = bias
r = learning rate
w_i = initial weights (should be k in number)
x_ij = i^th entry of j^th input
d_j = j^th desired output

x_ij and d_j form the Training Set
