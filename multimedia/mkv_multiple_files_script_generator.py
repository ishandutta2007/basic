# Code to write mkvmerge script that can work on several files
# on which same operations need to be applied. This can be useful
# in muxing TV episodes

# ALL YOU NEED TO DO
# Specify following inputs:
#   bfln = output script filename that will contain mkvmerge command (str)
#   mmaddr = location of mkvmerge, if it is in path simply use mkvmerge (str)
#   destination = path of folder where output media will be written, make
#                 sure it ends with / or \, leave blank to use current folder (str)
#   fyls = list of input files to be muxed, use append to add different sets of files,
#          all sets should have same number of files (list of list of str)
#   mmgops = mkvmerge global options, check below for some help on what options to use (str)
#   mmiops = mkvmerge options for each set of input files, check below for some help on
#            what options to use. its size should be same as fyls (list or tuple)
#   nms = new names of output files, set '' to use original names (str or list of str)
#   nmprfx = prefix to use for new names, set as (c0, n, c1) where c0 and c1 are prefix and suffix
#            of numbering that starts from n, set n=-1 to ignore this option (list or tuple)

# mkvmerge options
# check https://mkvtoolnix.download/doc/mkvmerge.html for detailed explanations

# Each str in mmiops will give mkvmerge input file options to that set of files
# Inclusion/exclusion of tracks:
#   -s 2, only uses subtitle track 2
#   -a hin, only uses hindi audio tracks
#   -a 2,3,4, only uses audio tracks 2,3,4
#   -a !1, uses all audio tracks except 1
#   Track IDs of streams can be checked using mkvmerge --identify filename (I think  MediaInfo shows +1),
#   they are usually 0 for video, 1 onwards for audio and later for subtitles
#   use -a for audio, -s for subtitle, -d for video, -m for attachments
# To exclude all tracks of particular type:
#   --no-audio, --no-video, --no-subtitles, --no-chapters, --no-attachments, --no-global-tags
# Language tag of tracks can be set using:
#   --language 0:eng, sets language eng for track ID 0
# To include chapters file for each input file, load chapters
#   files in fyls and set '--chapters' in corresponding mmiops

# In global options mmgops, track order can be defined as:
#   --track-order 0:0,0:2,1:4, sets first track of output
#   file as first track from first input file, then next track is
#   third track from first input file, then next track is fifth track
#   from second file. order of other tracks is automatically decided
#   after ordering these
